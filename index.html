					<h3>About Me</h3>
						<p>Hi there! I'm Ariela Lu YE, a Ph.D. student in the linguistics department at Rutgers University. 
							The interface between semantics, pragmatics and syntax remains one of the most intricate challenges in formal linguistics, 
							and is the Everest that I aspire to surmount as part of my long-term career. 
							The topics I am thinking about now are biased questions, <i>wh</i>-conditionals, modal indefinites, conditionals, 
							perspective-sensitive items, and speech verb <i>shuo</i>. 

							I studied at University of Southern California as a Ph.D. student before transferring to Rutgers 
							and I'm also an active member of S-Side Story and Meaning Lab directed by Roumyana Pancheva and Alexis Wellwood respectively. 
						</p>
